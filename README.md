# Pokemon-Top-Trumps
I'm thrilled to share with you my very first Python project: the Pokémon Top Trumps game. This game lets you compare Pokémon attributes using an API.

**Game Overview:**
This game is a Python-based adaptation of the classic Top Trumps card game, featuring your favourite Pokémon. It offers both a basic and an advanced version to cater to different levels of gameplay.

**How to Play**
Basic Game:
In the basic version, you and your opponent each receive a random Pokémon. 
You get to choose a stat to compare (ID, height, or weight).
The game then calculates and displays the winner based on the selected stat.
You win if your Pokémon's stat is higher than your opponent's.

Advanced Game:
In the advanced version, you'll participate in a series of rounds (3 rounds by default).
For each round, you're presented with three random Pokémon to choose from.
You select one Pokémon and pick a random or custom stat to compare.
The game computes the winner of the round based on the chosen stat.
Your score is updated depending on the difference between the stats.

**Winning:**
In both versions, you can win rounds based on your Pokémon's stats.
The advanced game keeps track of your cumulative score, and the player with the highest score emerges as the winner.

**High Score**
After completing the game, you have the option to save your high score. Just enter your name, and your score will be saved in a CSV file, which is sorted by high score.
